# SBpitch
Statsbomb have released a [free dataset](https://statsbomb.com/resource-centre) to help the public get used to their data product but also provide data to kick start people's journey into football analytics. 

To help people on their journey I have created a R package that creates customisable plots of pitches in ggplot2 that allows event data to be plotted on top. 

## Installation 

Installation is straight forward via the devtools package and the install_github() function. 

```R
devtools::install_github("FCrSTATS/SBpitch")
```

## The Default Plot 

The package offers lots of customisable features but the default plot is as follows:
